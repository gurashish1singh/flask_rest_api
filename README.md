# Flask Rest API

This is a super basic Flask-Rest API (almost a template with dummy endpoints) with SQLlite as the database and SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

The **pyproject.toml** file contains project dependencies and can be updated to add more dependencies at any stage of the project by running `poetry add <packagename>`.
Minimum Python version supported is 3.8.

The **.pre-commit-config.yaml** contains all the formatter and linters that runs before committing and before pushing changes.
